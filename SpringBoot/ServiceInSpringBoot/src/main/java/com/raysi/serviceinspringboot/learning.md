Here’s a description of the concept behind the Spring Boot application you’ve shared:

Concept Overview:

This Spring Boot application follows the MVC architecture (Model-View-Controller) to structure the web service. The goal is to expose a simple API that provides product information. Here’s a breakdown of how the different components interact:
1.	Controller Layer (@RestController):
•	The controller is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and returning responses.
•	HomeController handles the root URL (/) and returns a simple string message (“Home Page”).
•	ProductController handles requests to the /products URL and returns a list of Product objects in JSON format. It interacts with the Service Layer to get the list of products.
2.	Service Layer (@Service):
•	The service layer handles the business logic and data management for the application.
•	ProductService is responsible for managing the list of products. It returns a hardcoded list of products (in this case, Earbuds and Mobile) when the products() method is called.
3.	Model Layer (@Component or @Data):
•	The model represents the structure of the data being used in the application. In this case, Product is a model class that contains the attributes prodName, prodDomain, and prodPrice.
•	Product has a no-argument constructor and a parameterized constructor, along with getter and setter methods, allowing Spring to serialize and deserialize the data.

Key Annotations:

	•	@RestController: Marks the class as a RESTful controller that handles HTTP requests and responses in a REST API style.
	•	@RequestMapping: Maps a method to a specific URL endpoint, allowing the controller to handle requests to that URL.
	•	@Autowired: Used for dependency injection. It automatically wires the ProductService into the ProductController.
	•	@Service: Marks a class as a service, containing business logic or data retrieval functionality.
	•	@Component: Marks the Product class as a Spring bean, allowing it to be managed by the Spring container.

Flow:

	1.	Request Handling: A request to /products is received by the ProductController.
	2.	Business Logic: The controller calls the ProductService to get the list of products.
	3.	Response: The ProductService returns the hardcoded list of Product objects.
	4.	JSON Conversion: Spring automatically converts the list of Product objects into JSON format and sends it back in the HTTP response.

This is a basic implementation of a RESTful service in Spring Boot where you use the Controller-Service pattern to separate concerns and manage your application’s logic.
